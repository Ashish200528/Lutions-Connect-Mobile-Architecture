# Lutions Connect - Mobile Architecture Case Study

> **Disclaimer:** "Lutions Connect" is a proprietary commercial application developed for **Lution Group**. This repository does NOT contain source code or internal business logic. It serves as a technical case study demonstrating the system architecture, engineering challenges, and solutions I implemented as the Lead Mobile Developer.

## 📱 Project Overview
**Lutions Connect** is a cohesive platform merging **Real-time Messaging** with **Professional Recruitment**. It enables users to chat, manage groups, and navigate complex job recruitment workflows in a unified mobile experience.

The application was built to solve a specific problem: bridging the gap between casual professional networking and formal hiring processes, all while maintaining 100% data integrity in low-network environments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

### Core Framework
* **Flutter & Dart:** Cross-platform mobile development.
* **Provider:** Dependency injection and state management using the `ChangeNotifier` pattern.

### Backend & Infrastructure
* **Node.js (REST API):** Handles authentication, user data, and job workflows.
* **Socket.IO:** Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
* **Supabase:** Cloud object storage for media assets (chat images, profile pictures).
* **Firebase (FCM):** Push notifications for background alerts and deep linking.

### Local Persistence & Offline
* **Hive (NoSQL):** High-performance local database for caching messages, user profiles, and job feeds.
* **Shared Preferences:** Secure storage for session tokens and theme preferences.

### Key Libraries
* `connectivity_plus`: Real-time network status monitoring.
* `flutter_screenutil`: Pixel-perfect responsive design across device sizes.
* `cached_network_image`: Efficient image caching with custom retry logic.
* `intl`: Date formatting and localization.

## 🏗️ Key Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### 1. The "Offline-First" Architecture
**Challenge:** Users in areas with unstable internet lost data if they sent messages or applied for jobs while offline.
**Solution:**
* **Command Pattern Implementation:** Designed a custom **Action Queuing System**. When offline, user actions (e.g., `SendMessage`, `ApplyJob`) are serialized into `PendingAction` objects and stored in Hive.
* **Singleton Connectivity Service:** Implemented a singleton service listening to `connectivity_plus` streams. It broadcasts network state changes globally across the app.
* **Background Sync Engine:** Developed a `SyncService` that triggers automatically when connectivity is restored. It retrieves queued actions from Hive and processes them sequentially with exponential backoff logic.
* **Result:** Achieved "Optimistic UI" updates where the app feels instant, while ensuring data consistency with the server.

### 2. Real-Time Synchronization & Timezones
**Challenge:** Users in different timezones experienced message ordering bugs, and group chat states became inconsistent.
**Solution:**
* **UTC Standardization:** Enforced strict UTC timestamps across the entire stack (Database → API → UI) to ensure chronological consistency.
* **Global Event Listeners:** Engineered a decoupled `SocketService` that listens for events like `new_message` or `group_update` globally. It updates the local Hive cache immediately, ensuring the UI is consistent even if the user is on a different screen.
* **Delivery Receipts:** Implemented a real-time status system (Sent → Delivered → Read) using socket acknowledgments.

### 3. Complex State Management (Provider Architecture)
**Challenge:** Managing interdependent states (e.g., a Job Application status affecting a Chat Room) without spaghetti code.
**Solution:**
* **Decoupled Providers:** Split logic into specialized providers:
    * `ChatProvider`: Handles message history and local caching.
    * `JobProvider`: Manages the recruitment state machine (Applied → Shortlisted → Hired).
    * `FriendProvider`: Syncs real-time online/offline status updates.
* **Dependency Injection:** Utilized `MultiProvider` to inject core services (`AuthService`, `DatabaseService`) into UI consumers, making the code testable and modular.

### 4. Dynamic Theming Engine
**Challenge:** The app required a customizable UI that could adapt to user preferences without restarting.
**Solution:**
* Built a **Dynamic Theme System** that caches user preferences (Light/Dark/Custom Color Schemes) locally using `ThemeStorageService`.
* Implemented a custom `ThemeProvider` that rebuilds the `MaterialApp` widget tree instantly upon selection, providing a seamless user experience.
